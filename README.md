# Customer-Segmentation
The goal of this project is to develop a Customer Segmentation system that predicts the right group for new customers. This system will help in understanding and categorizing customers based on their attributes and behaviors, enabling targeted marketing strategies and personalized customer experiences.

The project involves the following steps:

Data Exploration, Preprocessing, and Visualization:

Explore the available customer data to gain insights into the variables and their distributions.
Handle missing values, if any, through imputation or deletion.
Preprocess the data by scaling or normalizing the features to ensure compatibility with clustering algorithms.
Visualize the data using plots, charts, or other techniques to understand patterns and relationships between variables.
Clustering Algorithms (K-means and PCA):

Apply the K-means clustering algorithm to group customers based on their similarities in feature space. The number of clusters should be determined based on domain knowledge or using an appropriate evaluation metric.
Implement Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of the data and extract the most important features that contribute to customer segmentation.
Compare and evaluate the performance of K-means clustering and PCA algorithms on the given dataset.
Model Evaluation:

Evaluate the clustering model using appropriate performance metrics such as silhouette score, inertia, or Davies-Bouldin index.
Analyze the results to determine the effectiveness of the clustering algorithm in creating distinct and meaningful customer segments.
Adjust the clustering parameters or consider alternative algorithms if the results are not satisfactory.
Customer Segmentation System:

Develop a system that takes the attributes of new customers as input and predicts their appropriate segment or group.
Utilize the trained clustering model to assign new customers to the identified clusters.
Provide an interface or API for easy integration with other systems or applications.
